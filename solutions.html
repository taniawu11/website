<h2 class="pagetitle">how can YOU help?</h2>
<p class="introtext">Global warming is a serious problem and even you can (and should!) contribute. Here are some ways you can help to save the planet!</p>

<h3 class="sectiontitle">things you can do everyday</h3>
<p class="introtext">It is important that citizens also try their best to make a change. Here are several everyday solutions that everyone can do:</p>
<img src="tap 2.jpg" class="leftimg" style="width:220px;height:300px;">
<p class="text">
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - switch to compact fluorescent lamps or LED lights
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - turn off electrical appliances when they are not being used
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - maintain the air-conditioner at 24 °C to 26 °C
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - reduce showering time
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - turn off the tap when brushing teeth
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - use appliances with better energy efficiency
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - when buying cars, buy one with a high gas mileage and low emissions
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - reuse and recycle items
<br style="margin-top:10px;"> - avoid products with a lot of packaging
</p>

<h3 class="sectiontitle">if you own or are a part of a business/organization</h3>
<img src="business.jpg" class="rightimg" style="width:250px;height:170px;">
<p class="introtext">While it is important that everyday citizens reduce their carbon footprint, bigger parties like companies and organizations will produce more carbon dioxide than the average citizen, so it is extremely important that bigger groups try their best to reduce their carbon footprint. Even if you are not the head of a company/organization, you can suggest to your superiors that your business tries the following methods:</p>
<p class="text">
<br>
<strong>stop using paper</strong>
<img src="paper.jpg" alt="companies should cut down on paper use" style="width:250px;height:240px;" class="leftimg">
<br style="margin-top:10px;">
 Around 50% of business waste is composed of paper ("Paper Waste Facts", 2019), and the paper industry contributes to 1% of greenhouse emissions. While 1% may not seem like a lot, the paper industry in the US only can produce around 37 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, so it is still important to try to cut down on our use of paper. With the technology our world currently possesses, companies going paperless is not as hard as you might think it is. Traditional mail and letters have most likely been replaced by email, and other paper processes can be easily replaced by electronic processes as well. For example, a company’s documents can be stored online with a tool like Google Docs. Job application forms, donation forms, survey forms, etc. can be created and stored online, which is more accessible, meaning that while a company is reducing its carbon footprint, it can also organize itself better.
<br>
<strong>recycle e-waste</strong>
<img src="e waste.jpg" alt="e waste is harmful" style="width:240px;height:150px;" class="rightimg">
<br style="margin-top:10px;">
New devices and technology are always being released, meaning that older models are tossed into the trash, which is harmful to the environment. Most e-waste is shipped to developing countries, where they are shredded, burned and dismantled. This process releases emissions that are harmful to both the environment and humans. Therefore, when companies have finished using electronic devices like tablets, computers, and printers, they should not simply throw them away, but should find the nearest e-waste recycling center.
<br>
<strong>allow employees to work at home</strong>
<img src="working.jpg" alt="employees should be allowed to work at home" style="width:240px;height:150px;" class="leftimg">
<br style="margin-top:10px;">
One of the biggest contributions to greenhouse gas emissions is transport, which is responsible for 15% of carbon dioxide emissions. When employees go to and from the office, they are bound to cause some kind of pollution. Offices also use air conditioning, leave appliances running, use non-efficient lighting, etc. Letting employees work at home, even for only one day a week, can reduce the carbon footprint of the company.
<br>
<strong>choose green materials</strong>
<img src="packaging 2.jpg" alt="companies should use eco-friendly packaging" style="width:230px;height:200px;" class="rightimg">
<br style="margin-top:10px;">
Companies, no matter what kind of services they provide, will order materials and supplies. These materials and supplies will come in packaging, which is often plastic or Styrofoam. Companies should try to order in bulk, and avoid plastic packaging. If the company manufactures and distributes goods, they should try to use eco-friendly packaging, and when distributing the goods, they should take note of what fuel is used to fuel their vehicles, and what vehicles they use. Switching to hybrid or electric vehicles, and fueling vehicles with renewable energy sources, such as biodiesel, can reduce the company’s carbon footprint.

<h3 class="sectiontitle">what is already being done?</h3>
<img src="protesting global warming.jpg" alt="people gathering and raising awareness of global warming" style="width:280px;height:150px;" class="leftimg">
<p class="text">In recent years, the public has become more aware of the problem of global warming. People have started petitions to request governments, companies and organizations to combat global warming. Companies, especially food service companies, have tried to reduce the usage of straws by not providing them to customers unless specifically requested. Activists have attended global warming summits to give speeches, trying to convince people of the severity of global warming so that more people will try to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="sectiontitle">what is Hong Kong doing?</h3>
<img src="solar farm.jpg" alt="Hong Kong gets some of its energy from solar energy" style="width:230px;height:200px;" class="rightimg">
<br style="margin-top:10px;">
<p class="text">Currently, Hong Kong has several climate change initiatives. We are trying to reduce our use of coal for electricity generation, and trying to increase non-fossil fuel sources for less carbon emissions. The manufacturing of coal-fired generating units have been banned since 1997 in favor of natural gas, which produces 50% less greenhouse gases for the same amount of electricity produced. A power company has already installed photovoltaic cells (solar panels) at its power plants, and a couple of power companies are exploring the idea of offshore wind farms. The Drainage Service Department’s solar farm is able to produce 25% of the energy needed for the department’s work at Siu Ho Wan Sewage Treatment Works. The government also promotes turning waste into energy - for example, a sludge treatment facility in Tuen Mun possesses the capability to turn thermal energy produced in the facility into electricity, which can supply the treatment facility’s power needs. Any excess energy can be uploaded to the power grid.</p>
