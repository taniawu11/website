<h2> how do we know global warming is happening?</h2>
<p>Most of us are aware of global warming's existence - but how do we know it's actually happening? What evidence is there that shows global warming is real and affects us?</p>

<p>The evidence for global warming is unequivocal - technologies like satellites that orbit the earth have collected many different kinds of information about our planet’s climate globally. This data has been collected over many years, and has revealed obvious changes in the globe’s climate. Ice cores taken from Greenland, Antarctica, and other glaciers have shown that the planet’s climate changes according to greenhouse levels. Other evidence can be gathered from tree rings, coral reef, layers of sedimentary rock, and ocean sediments. This ancient evidence shows that the globe’s current warming is occurring approximately ten times faster compared to the average warming that occurs when the earth recovers from an ice age. The average temperature has risen by 0.9 °C since the late 19th century, with most of the warming occurring in the last 35 years, and the ocean has warmed by 0.59 °C in the past 135 years. Additionally, ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have decreased in mass, with Greenland losing 286 billion tons of ice per year and Antarctica losing 127 billion tons per year. The global sea level has risen by about 8 inches in the past century, with the rate accelerating every year, and the acidity of the ocean has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution</p>
