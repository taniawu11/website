<h2 class="pagetitle">what has global warming affected?</h2>
<p class="introtext">Global warming has affected our world in many different ways, including causing ice melt, extreme weather, and damage to human health.</p>

<h3 class="sectiontitle">extreme weather</h3>

<p class="text">Global warming is fueling longer and hotter heat waves, more frequent droughts, heavier rainfall, and more powerful hurricanes. Since the ocean is getting warmer as well, tropical storms can pick up more energy, making them more dangerous. California’s drought in 2015 - which was its worst in 1,200 years - was intensified by 15% to 20%, as higher temperatures boost evaporation, which dries out soil during the summer. As more evaporation leads to more moisture in the atmosphere, there are heavier rainfalls, as well as more snow in the winter months. The number of heat waves, which can sometimes cause death, are currently almost triple of the average. Floods have also been affected, either being caused or affected by extreme weather as well as some other human-related factors. Heavy or prolonged rainfall, snowmelt, thunderstorms, and storm surges from hurricanes can affect floods, as well as structural failures in dams and levees. Floods are a serious problem, as from 1980 to 2009, floods caused more than 500,000 deaths and affected 2.8 billion people. Floods can also cause billions of dollars in crop and property damage.</p>

<h3 class="sectiontitle">ice melt</h3>

<p class="text">Another effect of global warming is ice melt. There is now 10% less permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere than there was in the early 1900s. The thawing of permafrost can cause landslides, as well as the release of long-buried microbes, which can cause outbreaks of sickness. The melt means that less heat is reflected back into the atmosphere by the surface of the ice, so the ocean absorbs the heat, creating a loop that causes even more melt. The melt also causes a rise in sea level, which in turn can cause coastal flooding, destroying property and even taking lives. Rising temperatures are now affecting wildlife and their habitats - loss of ice have threatened animals such as the Adélie penguin in Antarctica, where some populations have collapsed by 90% or more.</p>

<h3 class="sectiontitle">human health</h3>
<div>
<img src="human health.jpg" class="leftimg" style="width:275px;height:165px;">
<p class="text">Global warming can cause poor air quality - sunlight, warm air and pollution from the burning of fossil fuels combine to create ground-level ozone, or smog, which we experience as poor air quality. Increasing temperatures can intensify the smog. Global warming can also cause allergens and other nuisances. Warm temperatures and high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can help plants grow faster and produce more potent allergens. Common allergens, such as ragweed, seem to respond particularly well to high levels of carbon dioxide, as do plants like poison ivy. Warmer oceans and other waters could mean severe outbreaks of cholera and harmful bacteria in some seafood. As mentioned before, the melting of permafrost can also cause sickness as long-buried microbes are released into the air.

<h3 class="sectiontitle">effects on Hong Kong</h3>
<img src="hong kong.jpg" style="width:1200px;height:200px;padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;">
<p class="text">Just like the rest of the world, Hong Kong has been warming, having an increase in the number of hot nights and a decrease in the number of cold days. Hong Kong has also been experiencing heavier rainfall than before, and records in Victoria Harbor since 1954 has shown an unmistakable rise in mean sea level.</p>
