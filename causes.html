<h2>what causes global warming?</h2>
<p>Global warming is caused by greenhouse gases, which are gases like carbon dioxide and methane. They trap heat from the sun, which warms the earth. This is known as the greenhouse effect. It’s commonly thought that the greenhouse effect is bad for the environment, but did you know that greenhouse gases occur naturally?</p>

<h3>natural production of greenhouse gases</h3>
<p>The greenhouse effect itself is a naturally occurring process and ensures that the planet is warm enough for life to exist. When the Sun’s energy reaches the Earth’s atmosphere, some of the energy is reflected back into space, and some of it is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated to the Earth. This maintains the Earth’s temperature at around 33 degrees Celsius, which allows a wide variety of life to exist on Earth. </p>

<h3>human production of greenhouse gases</h3>
<p>However, human activities have caused an excess production of greenhouse gases, and have changed the natural greenhouse. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans began using fossil fuels like coal and oil as their primary energy source. The burning of fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide, as the carbon in the fuel combines with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide. As you can see from the graph on the left, atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased ever since the Industrial Revolution. Our modern industrial activities have caused the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million in the last 150 years. Too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that too much heat is absorbed and too little is able to escape, causing the globe to warm. The clearing of land for agricultural, industrial, and other uses have also, to some extent, increased greenhouse gas concentrations, as felled trees and logs can emit greenhouse gases. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, so if they are felled, they can no longer absorb the gas, meaning that there will be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
